# SunPy Core Roadmap

## 2.0 (May 2020)

* Add support for spectra.
  * Add Fido clients that provide spectral data (e.g. SDO/EVE, IRIS raster, MinXSS, Solar Spectral Irradiance)
  * Implement Spectrum factory
  * Implement GenericSpectrum class
* Implement NDCube as base class for Map objects.
* Expand solar models (e.g. canonical flare spectrum, coronal density as a function of height)
* Improve CompositeMap support and provide support for overlaying images for visualization using reprojection
* Improve Fido attribute discovery

## 3.0 (May 2021)

## Future
The following roadmap items should be scheduled to particular releases as appropriate.

* Provide support for fitting spectral models to spectra.
* Add support for multidimensional datasets with NDCube as base class.
